This is the Library Management Studio developed for the Intern student at the Tribhuvan University.
This project is developed using the PHP and JavaScript.
I believe this project will be helpful to anyone who wants to start developing the project in the PHP.
It has all the functionality from the DashBoard for the Admin and the Student to the book reservation and fine on the late return.
